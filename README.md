# CS-Paint

Java Based MS Paint Application

## Description

This was a project I did for my Computer Progrmaming course, CSCI 24000. The goal was to effectively showcase the material we learned throughout the semester (OOP design concepts, serialization, etc.) using one of the languages shown in class, in this case Java. The general idea was to recreate Microsoft's MS Paint application using the Java programming language.
