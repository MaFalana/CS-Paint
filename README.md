# CS-Paint

Java Based MS Paint Application

## Description

CS Paint (Like MS Paint but w/ Computer Science). Just a simple Java app that will consist of two main GUI: the color picker will use sliders adjusting hue and light to produce a color, features include a cursor that will drag on an uploaded image and return a hex value and rgb value(s). 
Using a custom color the user will be able to make and a new file that they can draw or write with a writing Utensil(Polymorphism), they can also save or delete the created image
The intended user is anyone who needs to gather basic information for a certain color. This project doesn’t really have a “problem”, but it will be useful in extracting color info from an image or producing a color 
I will be using the Java programming language for my GUI, and either Arraylists or Stacks with I/O for data management, a png file will be included for the icon of my GUI.
